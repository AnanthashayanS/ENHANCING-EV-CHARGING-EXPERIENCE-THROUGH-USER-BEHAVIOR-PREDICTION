# ENHANCING-EV-CHARGING-EXPERIENCE-THROUGH-USER-BEHAVIOR-PREDICTION
This project explores the development of a predictive model aimed at forecasting user behavior in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, specifically focusing on the prediction of available charging slots. 
	By leveraging historical usage data and incorporating factors such as time of day, day of the week, and special events, the model aims to provide real-time predictions. This enables EV drivers to efficiently plan their charging sessions, reducing wait times and enhancing the overall user experience.
